    <h2>Spatial Application For Accessing Tourism Repository</h2>

    <p>
     SAFAR is an acronym for Spatial Application For Accessing Tourism Repository. It is a user-friendly WebMap that is created using geospatial technology. 
    </p>

    <p>
      WebMap helps in converging various locational and descriptive information, which otherwise becomes difficult and time-consuming for tourists to gather from various sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      This WebMap provides information about tourism places in Banswara district. A number of options are attached in this WebMap such as the categorization of tourist sites, Show my location, distance to sites, time taken to reach, weather information, Nearby hotels & restaurants, and so on that can help the user in Geolocating efficiently.

    </p>

    <h2>Why Need for SAFAR</h2>

    <p>
    The objective behind the creation of SAFAR is to provide a digital platform for Banswara Tourism. Banswara district, owing to its geographical and sociocultural characteristics, possesses myriad tourist destinations; however, this place is still under the exploratory and incipient phase of tourism. Such a digital WebMap, which is turned into an Android application, can bring different stakeholders together, be it the administration, local public, researchers, or even the tourists.
